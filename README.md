I have been thinking about what I am passionate about in the past few years. I embark on a journey of self-discovery by reflecting on my past experiences and exploring my interests.

Unreal Engine is the most powerful creation tool for 3D visualization and immersive experiences. I used it to demonstrate the facade assembly process in virtual reality for the first time when studying at TU Delft. It is my most rewarding and enjoyable experience. In addition to my interest in the combination of art and technology, I made up my mind to become an Unreal Engine Developer.

In terms of my skillset, I can develop a simple but fully functional video game from beginning to end and create a virtual reality experience in Unreal Engine. Besides, I am capable of writing engine adjustments and plug-ins in C++. I am also interested in computer graphics and have knowledge of real-time rendering, ray-tracing, and graphics APIs.
